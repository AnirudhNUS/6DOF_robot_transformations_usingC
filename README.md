# 6DOF_robot_transformations_usingC
This set of modules makes transformation matrices and functions to do basic mathematical operations for a 6 degree of freedom robot.

This set of modules was made to mimic the basic functions of ROS (robot operating system) to control a 6 degree of freedom industrial robot using only C++. 
For the most basic transformations and operations, these modules should suffice.
